Croogo Site template plugin
------------------------------
Template plugin for custom site tweaks.

Use this template when a site requires some custom coding that doesn't fit in with a theme.
This template shouldn't be used for such things as a gallery, video etc... It's purely for small bespoke tweaks.

An example would be using a custom field for the page title which is included in the site component.


How to use
------------------------------
- Log in to admin panel
- Go to Extensions > Plugins page
- Upload the zip file (available here)
- Click on tick/cross icon of 'Site' for activating or deactivating the plugin


Notes
------------------------------
- Might be best to use a downloaded version that doesn't have git repo files
- Modify all the files if needed for bespoke site tweaks
